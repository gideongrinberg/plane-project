This directory contains the code to specify and optimize the design using AeroSandbox. main.py contains all of the core modelling logic. It is imported by design.qmd, which produces a document with some nice graphs using Quarto. It can also be run as a script.

design_files/ contains the images for design.md, which are automatically generated by Quarto from design.qmd.
